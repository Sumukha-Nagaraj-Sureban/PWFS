    <h2>What is SEO.?</h2>
    <p>SEO stands for search engine optimization. It's a set of practices that improve a website's visibility in search engines like Google. The goal of SEO is to get more organic traffic, which is unpaid traffic from search engines</p>

    <h3>Importance Of SEO</h3>
    <details>
        <summary>Visibility</summary>
        <p>When searching for a service or product online, users are more likely to choose one of the top five suggestions that the search engine shows them. After all, while Google may return thousands upon thousands of search results for any given term, the vast majority of searchers never make it past the first page, and more than 25% of people click the first search result they see. SEO helps you rank higher in search results and garner more visibility online, making potential customers more likely to click over to your site and convert.</p>

        <summary>Web Traffic</summary>
        <p>To put it simply—if potential customers can’t find your website, you miss out on sales opportunities. SEO increases your organic search engine traffic, in turn increasing the number of visitors your website sees each day. This directly correlates to an increase in sales—because the more relevant people see your site, the more chances you have to sell to them. </p>

    <details>
        <summary>Trustworthy</summary>
        <p>The better optimized your site is, the higher you’ll appear on search engines like Google and Bing. While ranking higher on Google is appealing to all brands because of increased visibility, a secondary benefit is the trust you gain with potential customers. Users tend to defer to the recommendations that a search engine generates, so having a higher position for the keywords a user is searching for will solidify your product or service as trustworthy in the user’s mind.         </p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>User Experience</summary>
        <p>
            A well-optimized website clearly communicates what product or service is being offered, shows how to obtain it, and answers any questions surrounding it. User experience is a major ranking factor for Google. This means that by catering the site to appeal to search engines like Google and Bing, you’re also catering it to the user’s experience. This means both search engines and users are able to easily get the information they need. On the other hand, if a user struggles to navigate your site, chances are that search engines will as well.</p>
